<h3>Details</h3>
    <h4>Outputs</h4>
        <p>
            <code>msg.payload</code> holds the syslog message received from the remote
            end-point. It is parsed, and structured into a javascript object.  All property values
            are either an <code>integer</code> or <code>string</code> datatype, with the exception of the <code>timestamp</code>
            property.  This property is a native javascript <code>DateTime</code> object.
        </p>

        <p>
            Meanwhile, <code>msg.topic</code> holds the <code>tag</code> value from the syslog message,
            but with any process id value and enclosing square braces (e.g. <code>[1]</code>) removed.
            This makes it easy to categorise syslog messages according to the application than generated
            them.
        </p>
    <h4>Description of Syslog Message Fields</h4>
        <dl>
            <dt>facility and facilityCode</dt>
            <dd><p>The <i>facility</i> argument is used to specify what type of program is logging the message.
            This lets the configuration file specify that messages from different facilities will be handled
            differently.</p>
            <p>There is a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Facility">definitive
            list</a> of facilities for syslog. This list can assist you to filter received syslog messages
             to the ones that most interest you.</p></dd>
            <dt>severity and severityCode</dt>
            <dd>
                <p>There are 8 severity levels.  They are:</p>
                <ol start=0>
                    <li>Emergency</li>
                    <li>Alert</li>
                    <li>Critical</li>
                    <li>Error</li>
                    <li>Warning</li>
                    <li>Notice</li>
                    <li>Informational</li>
                    <li>Debug</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The meaning of severity levels other than <i>Emergency</i> and <i>Debug</i> are relative
                to the application. Further information on the severity levels is available from
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Severity_level">wikipedia</a>.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>tag</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164#section-5.3">
            RFC3164</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>It has also been considered to be a good practice to include some
            information about the process on the device that generated the
            message - if that concept exists.  This is usually the process name
            and process id (often known as the "pid") for robust operating
            systems.  The process name is commonly displayed in the TAG field.
            ... The format of "TAG[pid]:" - without the quote
            marks - is common.  The left square bracket is used to terminate the
            TAG field in this case and is then the first character in the CONTENT
            field.  If the process id is immaterial, it may be left off.   </blockquote>
            <p>So depending on the software, sometimes the tag field value will have a trailing
            process id in square brackets, while other times, it won't.
            </dd>
            <dt>timestamp</dt>
            <dd><p><code>timestamp</code> will store the date and time of the message from the source.
            The timestamp records when the message was created, not when it was received.  It
            will be stored as a native Javascript <code>DateTime</code> object.</p>
            <p><b>Please Note: </b>Many syslog
            implementations do not include the year in the timestamp value. In such cases,
            this node will assume the current year.  This is important to note when processing
            historical syslog messages that may have been generated in previous years. You will
            need to take this into consideration. </p></dd>
            <dt>hostname</dt>
            <dd><p>The hostname is included in the message sent from the application. It is not determined
            by the IP address of the remote host, but rather by the local configuration on the sending
            device.  If the sending device does not have an explicitly configured hostname, <code>localhost
            </code> is commonly used. </p></dd>
            <dt>address</dt>
            <dd><p>This field records the IP address of the host that sent or forwarded the message to
            your node as a string. It is important to recognise that syslog supports message forwarding and that
            this field value may not necessarily match the originator of the message, but instead the
            last syslog server host to forward on the message. </p></dd>
            <dt>family</dt>
            <dd><p>The network protocol family representing the IP address is provided by this field.  Typically, it
            will be either <code>IPv4</code> or <code>IPv6</code>.</p></dd>
            <dt>port</dt>
            <dd><p>This field represents the TCP or UDP transport protocol port number the message was received
            on as per your node configuration. </p></dd>
            <dt>size</dt>
            <dd><p><code>size</code> will store the size of the entire encoded syslog message. This field is
            included for completeness, but provides little utility.</p></dd>
            <dt>msg</dt>
            <dd><p>The <code>msg</code> field holds the actual text message sent from the remote application. </p></dd>
        </dl>

<h3>Syslog Source Host Configuration</h3>

<p><a href="">Rsyslog</a> is a very popular open source syslog server for GNU/Linux and comes pre-installed and
configured on many distributions.  It can be changed such that, in addition to logging messages locally to files,
it can also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/v8-stable/configuration/modules/omfwd.html">send
syslog messages to a remote host</a>, such as your Node Red server. A quick synopsis of making this configuration
change is shown below.</p>

<p>Simply edit the <code>/etc/rsyslog.conf</code> file, and add the following lines. Editing this file will require
root privileges, so don&apos;t forget to use <code>sudo</code>.</p>

<pre>
#Write all messages to remote syslog using tcp port 20514
*.*  action(type="omfwd" target="192.168.1.8" port="20514" protocol="tcp"
            action.resumeRetryCount="-1"
            queue.type="linkedList" queue.size="50000")
</pre>

<p>The above configuration will send messages of all facilities and all priorities (i.e. *.*) to the IP address
192.168.1.8 using the TCP transport protocol. If messages can't be delivered to that IP and port number, then
messages will be locally stored in the meantime up to a total of 50,000 messages. Once it is able to connect,
messages stored locally will be forwarded.

<p>Replace <code>192.168.1.8</code> with the IP address of your Node Red Server.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> you will also need to restart your rsyslog server software. Most modern Linux distributions can
do this with the following command:</p>

<code>$ sudo systemctl restart rsyslog</code>

<p>If you prefer not to queue undelivered messages, use the following configuration.</p>

<pre>
#Write all messages to remote syslog using tcp port 20514
*.*  action(type="omfwd" target="192.168.1.8" port="20514" protocol="udp"
            queue.type="direct")
</pre>

<p>Don&apos;t forget to change your node to use UDP instead of TCP</p>
